<p><sub><sup> Last Updated: 04/08/2025 </sup></sub></p>

<p>This is a living document that aims to reduce ambiguity, build trust, and make it easier to work with me. It’s part guide, part open door - especially useful if you’re new to working with me or if we’re trying to collaborate more deeply. I’m sharing this to be transparent, but also to make space for you to do the same.</p>

<h2 id="-about-me">👨🏻‍💻 About Me</h2>

<p>I’m Phil - Head of Software Engineering and I am based on the edge of the New Forest. I live with my wife Emma and our two cats, Maggie and Matilda. I love learning, especially about history, and I’ve recently started learning piano so I can play songs from my favourite musicals 🎭. If you want to talk about <em>Les Mis</em>, <em>Blood Brothers</em>, or anything Musicals - I’m in.</p>

<p>I’m also a die-hard Kansas City Chiefs fan 🔴🟡 you may spot subtle hints about this when I work from home!</p>

<p>Professionally, I advocate for <em>DevOps as a culture, not just a toolchain</em>. I’m focused on building great developer experiences, sustainable engineering practices, and enabling organisations to move fast without breaking things that matter. I care deeply about strategy, automation, and helping engineers do their best work. My current focus is on establishing Specsavers’ Software Engineering capability by creating a clear, scalable operating model that enables our engineers to grow, develop, and deliver with confidence. I’m also leading on global governance for Software Engineering, ensuring we have the right principles, practices, and standards in place across regions. Alongside this, I’m accountable for the technical delivery of the Blended Experience Programme by guiding software engineering through complex transition states to ensure quality, consistency, and momentum.</p>

<p>The Specsavers behaviour I most identify with is <strong>🏃🏻‍♂️ Courageous</strong> - not just pushing for change, but helping others feel confident to come along for the ride.</p>

<h2 id="-what-i-do--how-i-think">🧑🏻‍💼 What I Do &amp; How I Think</h2>
<p>My role is to grow and scale our internal engineering capability - building both the strategy and the environment that enables our people to deliver great software, while also defining how we effectively partner with vendors, and independant 3rd-parties, to complement and extend our delivery model.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m contributing to the evolution of our engineering capability at Specsavers by shaping and supporting a long-term strategy for how we build and scale our software delivery. That includes influencing direction in areas such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Practice</strong> (craft, community, consistency)</li>
  <li><strong>Value stream engineering</strong> (optimising how we deliver end-to-end)</li>
  <li><strong>Core engineering</strong> (standards, tools, environments)</li>
  <li><strong>Innovation</strong> (time, space and sponsorship to explore ideas)</li>
  <li><strong>Governance and metrics</strong> (because we can’t improve what we can’t see)</li>
</ul>

<p>I care deeply about platform thinking, developer enablement, and how teams can balance autonomy with alignment. I try to zoom between strategic and tactical levels - one minute I’m talking about engineering operating models, the next I’m in the weeds of a CI/CD design. I’m happiest at the intersection of <strong>strategy and delivery</strong> - connecting high-level goals to the day-to-day work of our engineers. I move between coaching, problem-solving, facilitating alignment, and telling stories that bring our technical vision to life.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="-my-leadership-philosophy">🧭 My Leadership Philosophy</h2>

<p><em>I believe in creating clarity, removing friction, and enabling people to do their best work.</em></p>

<p>My leadership style is rooted in servant leadership and is outcome-oriented - I prioritise enabling and supporting my teams to thrive. That said, I’m not hands-off: I take clear ownership of outcomes, set direction with intention, and step in confidently when leadership and decision-making are needed. I don’t believe in micromanagement - I trust people to own their outcomes. My role is to remove blockers, ask useful questions, and help us stay aligned to our mission and values.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="-how-i-make-decisions">🛠 How I Make Decisions</h2>

<p>I use a mix of data, context, and instinct. I tend to ask:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Is this scalable and sustainable?</li>
  <li>Does this align with our direction and values?</li>
  <li>Who will this affect, and how can we include them?</li>
</ul>

<p>I prefer consensus where possible, but I will make clear decisions when needed. I’m happy to take accountability and explain the rationale behind any decision I make.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="-working-with-me-when">💻 Working With Me When…</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>When I’m focused on strategy or planning:</strong> I may be slower to respond. Feel free to follow up.</li>
  <li><strong>When things are moving fast:</strong> I’ll be more direct and may prioritise speed over detail.</li>
  <li><strong>When I go quiet:</strong> I’m likely thinking something through - reach out if you need me.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="-how-i-give-and-receive-feedback">🔁 How I Give and Receive Feedback</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I give feedback with intent to help, not to judge.</li>
  <li>I’ll praise in public but give critique in private.</li>
  <li>If I don’t give feedback immediately, it’s not because I didn’t notice - I might just be choosing the right moment.</li>
  <li>If I ever give feedback that feels off - tell me. I’m always learning and improving.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="-what-im-currently-focused-on">🛣 What I’m Currently Focused On</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Aligning Specsavers’ engineering function to the Long-Term Framework</li>
  <li>Technical delivery of the Retail Platform in a sustainable way with knowledge interalised</li>
  <li>Technical delivery of the Clinical Platform ensuring an effective evolution from SOCRATES Cloud</li>
  <li>Global oversight for technical alignment of Clincal and Retail platform supporting applications</li>
  <li>Supporting our Supply Chain teams in the delivery of their technical platforms and initiatives</li>
  <li>Creating a DevEx strategy rooted in platform thinking</li>
  <li>Maintaining practices and principles to scale engineering excellence through the Engineering Governance Framework</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="-my-working-style">💼 My Working Style</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I’m motivated by the <em>why</em>. I ask a lot of questions to make sure we’re solving the right problem.</li>
  <li>I want the context, not just the conclusion. Share the thinking behind decisions - especially if you’re asking for a steer.</li>
  <li>I prefer clarity over perfection - I’d rather see an early idea than a polished doc that’s too late to change.</li>
  <li>I prefer the problem over the solution - even if you’ve already picked a path, walk me through the decision.</li>
  <li>I like structured thinking but messy whiteboards - don’t be afraid to show half-formed ideas.</li>
  <li>I communicate best via diagrams, metaphors, and real-world parallels.</li>
  <li>I favour asynchronous tools and clear, complete communication. I’ll try to give you everything you need in one message.</li>
  <li>I default to optimism and forward momentum, but I value dissent and devil’s advocacy.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="️-strength-of-feeling-scale">⚖️ Strength of Feeling Scale</h3>

<p>I sometimes use a <strong>Strength of Feeling Scale Scale (1-10)</strong> ⚖️ to signal how strongly I feel about something. A “2” means I’ll go with the flow. A “9” means I care a <em>lot</em> and might be harder to sway. If I add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4/10</code> to a message or converstion this is me telling you how strong my conviction is.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="-how-you-can-help-me">🤝 How You Can Help Me</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I talk fast. If you need me to slow down or repeat something, just say so.</li>
  <li>I prefer feedback directly, and if it’s negative, a 1:1 is best.</li>
  <li>I value meeting agendas - they help me stay present and prepared.</li>
  <li>I live with tinnitus and often use music to help me focus. If I’m wearing headphones, tap me - I’ll let you know if I’m on a call.</li>
  <li>I’d rather know something that <em>might</em> change than not know it at all. I work better when I have the full picture, even if it’s messy.</li>
  <li>I challenge things I care about, but I value hierarchy. Let me know if I’m stepping outside my lane - I’ll appreciate the redirect.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="-what-i-assume-about-others">🧠 What I Assume About Others</h2>

<ul>
  <li>We both want to make things better - and we’ll get further by working together.</li>
  <li>You’ll let me know if something’s off - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">silence = agreement</code> in my book, so challenge me if needed.</li>
  <li>You have good intent, even if your message lands awkwardly - I’ll try to offer the same grace.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="-strengths">💪 Strengths</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I bring structure to complexity without killing creativity.</li>
  <li>I communicate clearly and can adapt messages for different audiences.</li>
  <li>I balance vision with pragmatism</li>
  <li>I’m comfortable thinking big and setting bold direction, but I’m equally focused on execution - turning vision into practical outcomes.</li>
  <li>I care deeply about people, quality, and delivery - in that order.</li>
  <li>I can articulate a vision <em>and</em> help people rally around it.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="-weaknesses">👎 Weaknesses</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I can become so passionate about a direction that I forget to revalidate the destination. Nudge me if that happens.</li>
  <li>I sometimes fixate on “the better way” at the cost of “the good enough for now”.</li>
  <li>I dislike inefficiency so much that I occasionally jump ahead of a process. Call me out if that affects team alignment.</li>
  <li>I can be impatient with unnecessary complexity or bureaucracy.</li>
  <li>I sometimes get lost in strategic work – nudge me if I go quiet on something operational.</li>
</ul>
